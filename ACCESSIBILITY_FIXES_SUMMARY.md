# Accessibility Improvements Summary

## Form Accessibility Audit Results

### âœ… Already Implemented (Found During Audit)
- **All forms have proper labels** - Every input field already has associated `<label>` tags
- **Proper id/for attribute pairing** - All labels are correctly linked to their inputs
- **ARIA attributes** - Forms include `aria-label`, `aria-required`, and `autocomplete`
- **Semantic HTML** - Forms use proper HTML5 input types (email, tel, etc.)

### ðŸ”§ Fixes Implemented

#### 1. Added Screen Reader Only Class (sr-only)
Added to `style.css`:
```css
.sr-only {
    position: absolute;
    width: 1px;
    height: 1px;
    padding: 0;
    margin: -1px;
    overflow: hidden;
    clip: rect(0, 0, 0, 0);
    white-space: nowrap;
    border: 0;
}
```

#### 2. Fixed Hidden Radio Buttons in enhanced-quote-section.html
- **Before**: `style="display: none;"` (inaccessible to screen readers)
- **After**: Used `class="sr-only"` to hide visually but keep accessible
- Added proper `id` attributes and `onchange` handlers
- Removed onclick from labels, moved to radio button onchange

#### 3. Fixed File Upload Accessibility
- **Before**: Clickable div with onclick handler
- **After**: Proper `<label>` element wrapping the upload area
- File input now uses `class="sr-only"` instead of `display: none`
- Maintains visual design while being fully accessible

### ðŸ“Š Accessibility Score Impact
These changes should improve accessibility score from 94 to ~98-100 by:
- Ensuring all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Making hidden elements available to screen readers
- Following WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines

### ðŸ§ª Testing Recommendations
1. **WAVE Tool**: Visit https://wave.webaim.org/ and test your pages
2. **Screen Reader Testing**: 
   - Windows: NVDA (free) or JAWS
   - Mac: VoiceOver (built-in)
   - Test form navigation and announcements
3. **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensure all forms can be completed using only keyboard

### âœ¨ Best Practices Already in Place
- Clear form labels with descriptive text
- Required fields marked with `aria-required="true"`
- Autocomplete attributes for better user experience
- Multi-step forms with clear progress indicators
- Form validation with helpful error messages

### ðŸŽ¯ Additional Recommendations (Optional)
1. Add `aria-describedby` for form hints/help text
2. Implement `role="alert"` for form submission messages
3. Consider adding skip navigation links
4. Ensure error messages are announced to screen readers

## Summary
The website already demonstrates excellent accessibility practices. The minor fixes implemented today address the only issues found during the comprehensive audit, bringing the forms to near-perfect accessibility compliance.
