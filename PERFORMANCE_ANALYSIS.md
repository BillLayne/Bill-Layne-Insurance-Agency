## Key Issues to Address

### 1. Desktop Performance (76 → 90+)
Desktop performing worse than mobile suggests:
- Large JavaScript bundles
- Render-blocking resources
- Unoptimized images (larger versions on desktop)
- Third-party scripts impact

### Common Performance Issues:
1. **Images**
   - Not using modern formats (WebP/AVIF)
   - Missing lazy loading on some images
   - Large image file sizes

2. **JavaScript**
   - EmailJS loading synchronously
   - Large app.js file (3000+ lines)
   - No code splitting

3. **CSS**
   - Large style.css file
   - Unused CSS rules
   - No critical CSS extraction

4. **Third-party Resources**
   - Google Fonts (already optimized but still impacts)
   - EmailJS SDK
   - External images from Unsplash/Imgur

### 2. Best Practices (81-82 → 90+)
Common issues:
- Mixed content (HTTP/HTTPS)
- Console errors
- Missing meta tags
- Image aspect ratios
- Browser errors

## Recommended Optimizations

### Immediate Fixes (High Impact)
1. **Optimize Images**
   - Convert to WebP format
   - Implement responsive images with srcset
   - Optimize file sizes
   - Ensure all images have lazy loading

2. **Split JavaScript**
   - Move analyzer system to separate file
   - Load JavaScript modules conditionally
   - Minify all JS files

3. **Optimize CSS**
   - Extract critical CSS
   - Remove unused styles
   - Minify CSS

### Quick Wins
1. Add `loading="lazy"` to remaining images
2. Add `fetchpriority="high"` to hero images
3. Preload critical resources
4. Add resource hints for third-party domains
