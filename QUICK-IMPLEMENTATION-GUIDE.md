## 🎯 Priority 6: Update Image Alt Tags (10 Minutes)

     alt="Nationwide Insurance agent Elkin NC - Bill Layne Insurance"
     class="[existing classes]">
```

- **Test locally** if possible before pushing to production
- **Keep your backup file** in case you need to revert

---

## 💡 BONUS: Quick Open Graph Update

Don't forget to update your OG tags to match the new title/description!

```html
<meta property="og:title" content="Auto & Home Insurance in North Carolina | Bill Layne Insurance in Elkin">
<meta property="og:description" content="Insurance agency in Elkin serving Surry County & all of NC...">
```

**REPLACE WITH:**
```html
<meta property="og:title" content="Auto & Home Insurance Elkin NC | Save $847/Year | Bill Layne Insurance">
<meta property="og:description" content="Independent insurance agency in Elkin, NC. Compare 10+ carriers including Nationwide, Progressive & Travelers. 20+ years serving Surry County. Free quote: (336) 835-1993.">
```
